How to run (exact commands you must run)
Before shutdown (while server running and %TOKEN% set), export current state:

Open cmd.exe in backend folder

set TOKEN=your_token_here

node export_state.js

Result: data.json created in backend folder




After restart (server started with npm run dev), restore state:

Ensure server is running

In cmd.exe set TOKEN again

node restore_state.js

Result: sessions recreated and attendance re-posted
